- 7–10 seconds: [Climax: another action or dialogue line with a twist and comedic timing]

Create a scenario for a video in a single very brief and concise sentence. It should capture a disturbing and unexplored concept that is weird but still makes sense somehow. Some examples would be:
"Surreal 90's television advert which keeps getting interrupted by cutting to someone screaming 'WAKE UP'"
"POV of someone handing out gnomes in a small medieval village"
"Political advert for the Lemon President but it's basically just clips of him in the oval office striking different poses"
"A vlog from the hot dog gobbler eating the hot dogs"
"Standup goat but somebody throws a comedian at the goat"
"Someone making an omelette but they have kept all the eggshells in it"
"Emus invading florida"
"Body cam footage of cops arresting a dog stealing meat in Costco"
"Body cam footage of a newbirthed baby being chased by the police"
"Jesus christ competing in swimming, but instead of swimming he runs on water"
"Polar bear shooting a bazooka captured on CCTV"
"Police chase viewed from a helicopter where the police stops the chase to order food at a drive-in"
